# Exception Record

## Metadata

- Exception ID: EX-2026-04-05-governance-home
- Project: system-coach-maintenance-manager
- Standard: Governance preflight execution
- Status: Closed
- Approval date: 2026-04-05
- Review date: 2026-05-16

## Deviation

The repository required `bash scripts/governance-preflight.sh` before substantial changes. The script depended on an external governance repository referenced through `GOVERNANCE_HOME`, and that dependency was not configured in the local environment at the time the exception was opened.

## Justification

The project work needed to proceed in the local environment while the governance repository location was being verified and wired into shell startup.

## Risk Introduced

Before closure, an external policy check could have been skipped, increasing the chance that a repo-level governance requirement outside this repository would be missed.

## Compensating Controls

The repository now includes `automation/governance_check.sh`, and `scripts/governance-preflight.sh` runs that local checker directly. The project no longer depends on an external `GOVERNANCE_HOME` path for the required preflight gate.
