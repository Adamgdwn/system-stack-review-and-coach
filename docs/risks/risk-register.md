## Key Risks

| ID | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Controls | Owner | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R-001 | Governance checks can drift if local controls and repository standards diverge. | Low | Medium | `scripts/governance-preflight.sh` now runs the repository-local `automation/governance_check.sh`; `project-control.yaml` documents governance level `1`, agent autonomy `A1`, and guarded user-approved action-runner enablement; preflight is required before substantial changes. | Adam Goodwin | Mitigated |
| R-002 | Probe agents may misidentify or miss tools in unusual local environments. | Medium | Medium | Short command timeouts, visible command log, bounded read-only probes, manual verification path in runbook. | codex session | Open |
| R-003 | Desktop launcher can become stale if the repository is moved after installation. | Medium | Low | Reinstall script, documented recovery steps, launcher path kept explicit. | Adam Goodwin | Open |
| R-004 | Filesystem mapping could scan a broader area than a user intended. | Medium | Medium | Opt-in root selection, no automatic full-system crawl, local-only processing, visible selected roots in UI. | codex session | Open |
| R-005 | Local AI coaching may produce incomplete or slightly incorrect explanations. | Medium | Medium | Local model status visibility, prompt grounded in the actual report/map, friendly but bounded coaching style, user can inspect raw findings directly. | codex session | Open |
| R-006 | Maintenance diagnostics may overstate or understate noisy operating-system evidence. | Medium | Medium | Diagnostics are read-only, command outputs are visible, findings preserve evidence, and recommendations require manual review before action. | codex session | Open |
| R-007 | Request or maintenance plans could produce commands that do not match the host platform. | Medium | Medium | Plan generation branches by platform, unsupported platforms return triage plans without commands, and tests cover Linux and Windows command families. | codex session | Open |
| R-008 | Users may mistake non-executable plans for runnable fixes. | Medium | High | Every plan marks `approval_required: true`; `execution_enabled` mirrors the contract gate; the Execute button shows execution mode, elevation prompt requirements, and blocked reasons. | codex session | Open |
| R-009 | Browser fallback support may lag native Linux behavior on Windows or less common Linux distributions. | Medium | Medium | Browser mode is treated as the cross-platform baseline, lazy imports avoid GTK requirements, and platform-specific request-plan hints are passed through the local API. | codex session | Open |
| R-010 | Privileged or broader modifying maintenance actions could raise the project risk tier. | Medium | High | Elevated execution is now explicit: plans must be exact, approval-required, in the elevated catalog, enabled by `elevated_action_runner_enabled`, and approved through the OS password/UAC prompt. Unsupported, placeholder, and uncatalogued commands remain blocked. | Adam Goodwin | Open |
| R-011 | Local history records could include machine details that a user does not want to share. | Medium | Medium | History stays local, the path is visible in the UI, records are JSONL for user inspection, and support handoff should use user-approved exports only. | codex session | Open |
| R-012 | Runnable low-risk actions may fail or only partially apply on an unusual desktop environment. | Medium | Medium | The runner uses exact command previews, a guarded executable catalog, `shell=False`, timeouts, captured output, post-check notes, and local history records for completed, failed, and blocked attempts. | codex session | Open |
| R-013 | Elevated actions may fail, hang, or apply unintended system-level changes if the OS authorization path or command plan is wrong. | Medium | High | Elevated actions use `pkexec`/Polkit on Linux and UAC on Windows, require explicit Execute plus OS approval, display exact commands and risk, keep unsupported families blocked, capture results where the OS allows, and record outcomes in history. | Adam Goodwin | Open |
